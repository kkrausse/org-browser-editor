* org browser editor

A richtext org editor for the browser. Supposed to feel like you're editing in emacs written in ClojureScript with react.

There are two main parts of the repository
- a basic org editor with a demo
- an application built on it that has file navigation and node insert like org roam that uses a webdav server to get/write files.
